After a great few days of meeting new people and hearing great talks, the NYC SmashingConf has come to an end. Here are a few takeaways from the last few days!

### Naming is _Essential_ 

As both [Alla](https://twitter.com/craftui) and [Frances](https://twitter.com/phae) both said, having a shared language is great for team communication. By working together to define module names that accurately reflect the function of the module. And if you are not able to find a concise and relevant name, there is a chance you should reevaluate the purpose of the module.

### Outsource Complexity

Outsource complexity where you can! Sometimes this means avoiding the "hipster tax" - a term used by [Phil](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth) to describe the extra time spent learning the _noun_.js that is framework-of-the-day. Maybe it means letting SASS do the work. Maybe it means using a Jekyll paired with an open source CMS tool. By reducing complexity where possible, you can ensure that the next developer (most likely future-you) will be spending less time learning and more time coding. 

### Remove the Noise

Whether it's by using cool SVG animations like those presented by [Sarah](http://twitter.com/sarah_edo) to draw attention to a CTA, reducing unnecessary text as shown by [Kate](https://twitter.com/katekiefer), reducing load time using the techniques from [Mat](https://twitter.com/wilto), or using the correct HTML5 input types as shown by [Aaron](https://twitter.com/aarongusfson)... you should always work to reduce both the mental and literal bandwidth of the user. 

### Build Something Fun!

A SASS powered rocket built by [Roy](https://twitter.com/roy). A happiness machine by [Brendan](https://twitter.com/brendandawes). Beautiful curse words by [Seb](https://twitter.com/SebLester). We saw a lot of cool shit.

As my wife would attest, I have too many hobbies. Now I want to add 3D printing, IoT tinkering, and calligraphy to that list. 

It doesn't need to serve a purpose! As @brendandawes said, "building something that you think deserves to exist". See where you expirimentation takes you.
