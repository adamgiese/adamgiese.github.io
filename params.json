Working with [The MOD Studio](http://themodstudio.com), a partner of Intelechy Group, I have worked on WordPress themes for many different clients and industries. \r\n\r\nI am getting my feet wet with Jekyll, and I am _loving_ it! While I do not have any professional examples (yet), I am currently creating a Jekyll theme where this site will eventually live.\r\n\r\n## More Is On The Way!\r\n\r\nThis site is a placeholder! I will be populating this with blog posts, portfolio pages, and more!\r\n",
