### Create WordPress Sites

I have experience creating WordPress themes of all sizes: from simple blogs to web applications with custom admin interfaces and many interconnecting custom post types. Some of the WordPress themes that I have worked on include:

  * [Fifth & West](https://www.5thandwest.com), with The MOD Studio.
  * [Finspeed](http://www.finspeed.com), with The MOD Studio.
  * [PAPI Austin](http://www.artspro.com), with The MOD Studio.
  * [Curated: Exclusive Resorts](http://curated.exclusiveresorts.com), with Intelechy Group.
  * [WorkIt Personal Training](http://www.workittraining.com), with The MOD Studio.

### Page Speed Optimization

We are increasingly becoming more and more impatient with our websites. If your page isn't optimized for speed, you could be missing out on a large portion of users that bounce before the page can render. 

If you need help getting this fixed, I'm your guy!

### Create Jekyll Sites

If you are a blogger who wants a blazing fast site - Jekyll is perfect for you. With Github pages, you can host your Jekyll blog for free! In fact, this site is currently being hosted by Github pages using a custom Jekyll theme created by yours truly.
